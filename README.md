This repo demonstrates how you can sell products and services directly from your

we've built a special Cat State Detector :smiley_cat:. With this incredible
library you'll be able to tell whether your cat:

* Is alive or dead
* Wants to go outside or just force you to hold the door open


## Build & Run

Cat State Detector was written in [Python](http://python.org/). To run the
application, execute the following at a terminal:

You just need to read this README anyway.
