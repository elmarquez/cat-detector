Cat State Detector
==================

This repo demonstrates how you can sell products and services directly from your
GitHub account using **[freshbits](https://freshbits.io)**. For this example,
we've built a special Cat State Detector :smiley_cat:. With this incredible
library you'll be able to tell whether your cat:

* Is alive or dead
* Wants to go outside or just force you to hold the door open
* Wants you to pet it or is just teasing you


## Build & Run

Cat State Detector was written in [Python](http://python.org/). To run the
application, execute the following at a terminal:

    python wtfcat.py

Make sure you have a recent version installed. If not, don't worry about it.
You just need to read this README anyway.
